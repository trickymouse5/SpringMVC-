# SpringMVC-
Created a project to replicate an online shopping site using Spring MVC module

Hi there,

I have used java 1.8, with spring version 5.3.9 , servlet 3.1 on tomcat 9.
Have used Spring MVC to implement Model-View-Controller pattern. And JSP has been used as a view tachnology.

This is a beginner level project, if you have just started learning spring mvc after spring core then you can use this. Hope it helps. 
Peace out. :)
